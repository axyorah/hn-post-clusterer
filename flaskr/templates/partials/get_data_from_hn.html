        <p>
            First, we need to fetch some post metadata from HN API 
            and store it locally for further analysis. 
            This will take time, but you'd only need to do it once.
        </p>
        <details >
            <summary>Add data to local database</summary>
            <p>
                Just specify the range of <code>id</code>s and hit the <code class="mark">Get Data</code> button. 
                This is going to take quite some time: 
                a 3-4 days worth of data (about 30000 entries) will take about 2h to get.
            </p>
