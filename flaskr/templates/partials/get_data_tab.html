        First, let's get some data from HN for further analysis.
        Just specify the range of <code>id</code>s and hit the <code>Get Data</code> button.
    </p>
    <p>This will take time, but you'd only need to do it once.</p>    

    {% include "partials/get_data_from_hn.html" %}

    <p>
        TODO: explain which texts are used for analysis (all post comments + title)
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's filter out the posts that would be used for analysis by <code>id</code>,
        <code>score</code> and <code>number of comments</code>.
        You can change these settings any time later.

    <p>TODO: show SQL query as details???</p>
